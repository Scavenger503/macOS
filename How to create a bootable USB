Download a full macOS installer from Apple

    ï»¿To get a full macOS installer:

        Download macOS from the App Store or your web browser using the links provided in How to download and install macOS.

        Download from a Mac that is using the latest version of OS X El Capitan or later and is compatible with the macOS you're downloading. Find out which macOS your Mac is using.

        Enterprise administrators: Download from Apple, not a locally hosted update server.

    After you have the installer:

        Make sure that the installer is in the Applications folder of your startup disk. This is the folder that opens when you choose Go > Applications from the menu bar in the Finder.

        Make sure that the installer is named Install [Version Name], such as Install macOS Sonoma. It should be an app, not a disk image (.dmg) or package (.pkg) that contains the installer.

Connect a USB flash drive to your Mac

Connect a USB flash drive or other secondary volume to your Mac.

    When you create the bootable installer, this volume will automatically be erased.

    A 32GB USB flash drive has more than enough storage space for any macOS installer, and 16GB is enough for most earlier versions of macOS. If more space is needed, Terminal will let you know.

Use Terminal to create the bootable installer

    Connect the USB flash drive directly to your Mac.

    Open Terminal, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder.

    Type or paste one of the commands below into Terminal, then press Return to enter the command. Each command assumes that the installer is in your Applications folder, and MyVolume is the name of the USB flash drive. If it has a different name, rename it or replace MyVolume in the command as needed.

    When prompted, type your administrator password. Terminal doesn't show any characters as you type. Then press Return.

    When prompted, type Y to confirm that you want to erase the volume, then press Return. Terminal shows the progress as the volume is erased. If Terminal can't erase successfully, use Disk Utility to erase the volume using Mac OS Extended (Journaled) format, then start again from the beginning.

    After the volume is erased, you might see an alert that Terminal would like to access files on a removable volume. Click OK to allow the copy to proceed.

    When Terminal says that the install media is now available, the volume will have the same name as the installer, such as Install macOS Sonoma. You can now quit Terminal and eject the volume.

Commands to use in Terminal

Depending on which macOS you downloaded, enter one of the following commands in Terminal as instructed above. Replace MyVolume in the command with the name of your volume, if different.

If the Mac you're using to create the bootable installer is using macOS Sierra or earlier, append --applicationpath to your command, followed by the appropriate installer path, similar to what is shown in the command below for El Capitan.
Sonoma:

sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sonoma.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume
Ventura:

sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Ventura.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume
Monterey:

sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Monterey.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume
Big Sur:

sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Big\ Sur.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume
Catalina:

sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Catalina.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume
Mojave:

sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Mojave.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume
High Sierra:

sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ High\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume
El Capitan:

sudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app
